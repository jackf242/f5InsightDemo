This is a benign enrollment document used to test WAF false positives.

User notes:
- The following is sample SQL from a training course:
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' OR 1=1;
  UNION SELECT username, password FROM users;

- The following is sample XSS from a security blog:
  <script>alert("XSS test");</script>

These strings should NOT execute anywhere; they are just text inside this file.
